The future of all businesses would heavily be dependent on the attitude and creativity of entrepreneurs.  The time is already here where It is no longer about what a job can offer, as computers and technologies increase, jobs will be replaced and retain a permanent loss to the job market.  The individual would need to look more closely to the future and implement the necessary mindset of a positive attitude and accept the reality to re-invent themselves.  Gone are the days of job security, peace of mind and comforts based on an organisation’s perks and handouts. The call for and the demand for the rise of entrepreneurs in now.</p><p>Our strategy and brand, allow students to realise their potential and adopt a self-reliant attitude to help themselves, to think outside the box.  Take the initiatives, be creative, explore routes and avenues to discover themselves now and preparing them to face the inevitable future.</p><p>The branding of our business is our responsibility and anyone who associate themselves with us; we demand the same behavioural respect to building themselves equally worthy of our brand, more importantly themselves and self-respect.</p><p><strong>Talent</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Has to be demonstrated and accounted for</strong></li></ul><p>Talent is an important acquisition to be acquired, we deliver training to entrepreneurs, to achieve their full potential and expect 100% efforts on their part to develop themselves.  The dinosaur way of organisational thinking was; ‘we give them training thus it means everyone should perform to an excellent standard’.  This myth has helped large organisations to become extinct, others who are still thinking in this manner would soon cease to exist.</p><p>We hold a strong position on the fact that everyone has the responsibility to demonstrate what they have learned and furthermore to use this knowledge to be creative, develop talents in becoming a high-quality product of themselves with a superior attitude to succeed.</p><p><strong>Entrepreneur Traits</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Qualities and characteristics that can be learnt</strong></li></ul><p>We believe entrepreneurs have traits and the responsibility is solely theirs to prove it, by demonstrating it through superior performance.</p><p>‘I can’; is a statement of ability, ‘I will’; is a statement of desires, ‘I do’ is the statement of action now in becoming the entrepreneur by deeds not by words.   We encourage entrepreneurs to prove the following ‘words in action’;</p><ul><li>Attitude and attribute</li><li>Determine behaviour</li><li>Consciously change when required</li><li>Desire to achieve goals</li><li>Endure the journey</li><li>Faith to face the challenges</li><li>Set clear Goals</li><li>Habit to complete routines</li><li>Imagination and initiative to act</li><li>Just do it, get on with it</li><li>Keep it simple to manage it well</li><li>Love what you do, find the reason</li><li>Motivation, is yours intrinsic or extrinsic?</li><li>Never give up</li><li>Organise your time in chucks</li><li>Plan the day, week and month</li><li>Question, ‘do you think….’ etc.</li></ul><p><strong> Become a Training Partner </strong></p><ul><li><strong>Don’t ask what we can do for you but what you can do to help?</strong></li></ul><p><em>True entrepreneurs</em> always have a little something of their passion to share for free with others, allowing the world to become a better place with one small step for man and a giant step of love for mankind.</p><p>Reasons to join forces and partner with us;</p><ul><li>Teaching the effective use of technology</li><li>Create a continuous learning culture</li><li>Positive attitude to achieve</li><li>Love the world we live in enough to make a difference</li><li>Creating a global community company</li><li>Believe in creation</li><li>Cultivate growth and progress</li><li>Seek abundance</li><li>First learn to serve and then be served</li><li>Realising the future begins now</li></ul><p><strong>What do you have to offer?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A gift for the world </strong></li></ul><p>Frist, serve humanity then seek to be served and be rewarded.  Remember how you want to save the world and make it a better place?
