<h2 style="text-align: left;"> </h2><p>Our business is strategically focused on being socially responsible as well as commercially driven, but doing so genuinely and effectively requires the strong vision we believe in and committed to our mission to effectively develop true Entrepreneurs to consider the local environment long term. We always seek a process that works with responsible third party who share similar know-how in looking after social development and drive added value outside of a business to the local community and minimise waste of every kind. Refurbishment and building works are known to produce tons of waste sometimes carelessly. We are mindful to use as much, give away, keep or re-cycle left overs.      </p><p>As a business we take our responsibility seriously, as to what we doing to address the neighbours on the street. Positively impact the activity is important as it gives us a good image and professionalism with the community. Now operating online, that part of the business, looks at the internal environment, with workplace diversity, technological changes with today’s demands for better effective human interaction even in the virtual space online. </p><p>The size of our projects does not so much affect the world on the outside as so much as it is growing online on the inside environment. Drawing inspiration and input from other property industrial leaders to the innovative thinking of helping those working online to care just as much how we impact the world; we still depend on the world outside for our survival. This topic will only increase in need for greater awareness as we see what is happening to the Amazon forest fires. With buildings accounting for 40% of global carbon emissions, we believe our responsibility goes far beyond traditional narrow goals centered on energy, water, waste, and the rain forest. we contribute to the WWF (Worldwide Funds and RFS (Royal Forestry Society).      </p><p>We share and echo the concerns as stated by RFS.org.uk; There is now added urgency to adapting our woodlands to climate change. Chair of the Forestry Climate Change Working Group (FCCWG), Simon Lloyd, said: <em>“Since the Climate Change Adaptation Plan was published a year ago by the FCCWG there have been a number of high-level reports charting the speed of climate change together with the Government’s recognition that we are facing a Climate Emergency”. </em></p>
