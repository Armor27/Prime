<h2>Our story</h2>		
Over the last 4 years of sweat, blood and tears, we have demonstrated a reasonable approach to a practical business strategy in the real estate market. Our capability in delivering sales strategies and managing our time with hard earn experience to meet our business plans and work to meet the needs of the higher market needs in the areas.  We know our customers have had a wonder property to be happy enough to call ‘home sweet home’.</strong>
Our journey has taken us from flipping, buy to rent, rent to rent, joint ventures and construction (abroad) to this point to help others on this successful journey and more importantly not to dream of success without avoiding the “Property Pitfall”.  This subject is not often or hardly spoken of. Like many we jumped in with two feet and we learned very quickly how not to get burnt from all the ‘Cowboy Rangers’.  Organised our process and got the best out of the so called ‘power team’. We have tips from hard earn experience that are up to date, not from the dinosaurs’ era.</strong>
We honestly seek the safety of those:</strong>
       
<ol>
 	<li> Thinking of entering the property tunnel, </strong></li>
 	<li> Having decided to enter the property ladder,</strong></li>
 	<li> Who have just started and have not had any training,</strong></li>
 	<li> Who have been operating for the last couple of years and are now stuck.</strong></li>
</ol>
We truly seek to share our experience to keep others safe in this tumult time and not be blinded by the hype within the property industry.  Where are those who have made losses? Why are they not telling us not to do XYZ, perhaps the embarrassment of losing the thousands of pounds! We offer a free registration to our free webinar, so take full advantage to avoid the inevitable danger of stepping into the property business without first being trained to the very least.</strong>
We are not fooled by those loud noises, and neither should you, thinking of the obvious opportunities that everyone dream of with safety nets, noting our experience unto profitability and so others can do the same . We don’t blame the market or expect magic, we kindly warn anyone not to enter the property market without some form of training that will not burn their pocket by thousands of pounds and not be fooled with  hype training out there we have seen it. Safety of opportunities lies within organised planning to teach others the safety road for your property success.</strong>
